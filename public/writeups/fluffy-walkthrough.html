    <title>Fluffy Walkthrough - V01 Cybersecurity Writeup</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Fluffy is an easy-difficulty Windows machine designed around an assumed breach scenario, where credentials for a low-privileged user are provided. By exploiting CVE-2025-24071, the credentials of another low-privileged user can be obtained. Further enumeration reveals the existence of ACLs over the winrm_svc and ca_svc accounts. WinRM can then be used to log in to the target using the winrc_svc account. Exploitation of an Active Directory Certificate service (ESC16) using the ca_svc account is required to obtain access to the Administrator account." />

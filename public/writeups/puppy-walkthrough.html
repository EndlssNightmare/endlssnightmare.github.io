    <title>Puppy Walkthrough - V01 Cybersecurity Writeup</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Puppy is an medium-difficulty Windows Active Directory machine built around an assumed-breach scenario where credentials for a low-privileged user are provided (levi.james / KingofAkron2025!). Initial SMB/BloodHound enumeration reveals GenericWrite on the Developers group, allowing the attacker to add the user and access the DEV share. A KeePass file harvested from DEV is cracked to recover additional credentials. A password-spraying and further enumeration lead to steph.cooper and extraction of DPAPI-protected secrets. Using steph.cooper_adm recovered credentials the box allows DCSync to dump the Administrator hash, enabling remote authentication and full domain compromise." />
